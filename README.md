# CCTV Weapon or Thief Detection

## Overview

This project focuses on developing an AI-based system for detecting weapons or potential thieves through CCTV footage. The system uses computer vision and machine learning algorithms to identify suspicious activity in real-time and trigger alerts. The aim is to enhance security measures in public and private spaces by providing early warning signals of potential threats.

## Features

- **Real-time detection:** Continuously monitors CCTV footage to detect the presence of weapons or suspicious behavior.
- **Alert system:** Sends notifications when a weapon or suspicious activity is detected.
- **Customizable detection models:** Supports training with custom datasets for specific weapon types or thief behavior.
- **Scalable and adaptable:** Can be deployed on various hardware configurations, from local computers to cloud servers.
- **Integration options:** Works with messaging services to send alerts to phones, emails, or security systems.
